# HuffmanEncoder
The goal of this project is to compress data by Huffman coding using the most suitable data structure. 
For this, huffman ecoder was implemented using 3 data structures, namely, binary heap, 4 way heap and pairing heap.
Finally, the file was compressed using the data structures which gave best performance which was pairing heap in this case.
